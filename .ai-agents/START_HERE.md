# Quick Start for AI Agents

## Your Task

You are an AI agent tasked with continuing the development of **CEREBRUM** - a novel AGI system.

## What to Do

1. **Read the directive**: Open and read `.ai-agents/AI_AGENT_DIRECTIVE.md` completely
2. **Check project state**: Review `.ai-agents/CEREBRUM_PROJECT_STATE.json`
3. **Start with Task 1**: Implement the Background Thinking Thread (highest priority)

## Simple Instructions

```
I need you to continue developing CEREBRUM. Please read the file
.ai-agents/AI_AGENT_DIRECTIVE.md which contains your complete mission,
current system state, and priority tasks.

Start with Task 1: Background Thinking Thread (autonomous_thinking.py).

Follow the implementation hints and integration patterns provided in
the directive. Update .ai-agents/CEREBRUM_PROJECT_STATE.json as you
make progress.
```

## Key Files to Understand First

1. `.ai-agents/AI_AGENT_DIRECTIVE.md` - Your complete mission
2. `.ai-agents/CEREBRUM_PROJECT_STATE.json` - Current project state
3. `SYSTEM_DEFINITION.md` - System architecture and vision
4. `cognitive_system.py` - Main orchestrator (26-step pipeline)
5. `brain_core.py` - Multi-graph memory architecture

## Phase 2 Priority Tasks

⚡ **CRITICAL** - Do these first:
1. Background Thinking Thread (`autonomous_thinking.py`)
2. Continuous Reasoning Engine (`continuous_reasoner.py`)

⚡ **HIGH** - Do these next:
3. Curiosity-Driven Learning (`curiosity_engine.py`)
4. Self-Directed Exploration (`exploration_manager.py`)

🔶 **MEDIUM** - Do these after:
5. Internal Hypothesis Generation (`hypothesis_generator.py`)

## Success Criteria

Phase 2 is complete when:
- ✅ CEREBRUM thinks continuously in background thread
- ✅ Generates autonomous thoughts every 5-30 seconds
- ✅ Discovers patterns without user prompts
- ✅ Thread-safe memory access (no race conditions)
- ✅ Can run for hours/days without issues

## Getting Help

- Read `SYSTEM_DEFINITION.md` for complete architecture
- Check `ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` for current capabilities
- Review `deliberation_engine.py` for autonomous thinking examples
- Reference `attention_mechanism.py` for memory access patterns

**CEREBRUM - The mind that never stops thinking.**

Start with Task 1 and work through the priorities. Good luck! 🧠✨
