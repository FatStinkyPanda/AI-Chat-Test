# CEREBRUM

## Continuous Evolving Reasoning and Brain-like Understanding Machine

**A novel approach to artificial general intelligence with continuous autonomous thinking**

---

## What is CEREBRUM?

CEREBRUM is **not a chatbot** - it's a continuously active artificial mind that thinks, learns, and reasons autonomously. It combines a brain-inspired multi-graph architecture with 7 advanced cognitive systems to achieve human-like and superhuman intelligence.

### Key Features

- 🧠 **Brain-Inspired Architecture** - Multi-graph memory with spreading activation
- 🔄 **Continuous Learning** - Learns from every interaction, no retraining needed
- 🤔 **Autonomous Deliberation** - Thinks on its own, decides when ready to respond
- 🎯 **Advanced Reasoning** - Causal chains, multi-step inference, analogical reasoning
- 💾 **Perfect Memory** - Remembers everything across all sessions
- 📊 **Knowledge Graphs** - Builds structured knowledge from conversations
- 🔮 **Predictive** - Anticipates conversation flow and user needs
- 🎓 **Meta-Learning** - Learns how to learn better
- 🔒 **100% Local** - No internet required, complete privacy
- 🆓 **Open Source** - Full control, fully customizable

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install sentence-transformers chromadb numpy

# Run CEREBRUM
python chat.py
```

### First Conversation

```
You: Hello! Tell me about your memory system.
CEREBRUM: [Thinks autonomously, then responds with deep understanding]

You: I'm interested in learning about quantum physics.
CEREBRUM: [Builds knowledge graph, discovers associations, provides insights]
```

## Architecture Overview

### 7 Advanced Cognitive Systems

1. **Causal Discovery Engine** - Discovers cause-effect relationships
2. **Multi-Step Inference Engine** - Chains reasoning to deep conclusions
3. **Conversation Predictor** - Predicts conversation trajectory
4. **Attention Mechanism** - Intelligently selects relevant information
5. **Knowledge Graph** - Extracts entities, relationships, and facts
6. **Meta-Learning System** - Learns optimal learning strategies
7. **Transfer Learning** - Applies patterns across contexts

### 26-Step Cognitive Pipeline

Every input triggers sophisticated processing:
- Perception & encoding
- Memory storage & retrieval with attention
- Knowledge extraction & causal discovery
- Multi-hop reasoning & inference chains
- Conversation prediction & strategy selection
- Autonomous deliberation (AI decides when ready)
- Response generation & learning

### Brain-Inspired Memory

- **Nodes:** Memories with content, embeddings, emotions
- **Edges:** 8 types (semantic, causal, emotional, temporal, etc.)
- **Activation:** Spreading activation like neurons
- **Working Memory:** Recent context (like human short-term memory)
- **Long-Term Storage:** Persistent across all sessions

## Future Vision

CEREBRUM aims to be:

**Not an assistant, but a colleague.**
**Not a tool, but a mind.**
**Not artificial intelligence, but genuine intelligence.**

**The first true AGI built for individuals, not corporations.**
**A mind that never sleeps, never forgets, and never stops learning.**
